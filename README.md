## Introduction
This repository is for our work **DisenStudio: Customized Multi-subject Text-to-Video Generation with Disentangled Spatial Control**. Our work aims to generate videos for the user-customized multiple subjects, according to the user-provided text descriptions, which enables controlling the location of each subject and supports different subjects to take different actions. The DisenStudio framework is shown in the following figure. More demos are given in the project page.
